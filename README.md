#### How To Create a "Page"

First of all, you need a template for your "page" so you need to create a html file with the elements you need.

Then you have to create FoldView constructor and link the previously template created with that FoldView constructor.

Each instance of FoldView's need unique id's so they can be destroyed property once they are not needed anymore.

As soon as you have the template and the view linked, you just need to create an instance of a FoldController and set the created FoldView as the main view. There's a set of automations made behind the scene to ease the manipulation of views by the controllers, that manages events for example.

Having these things done, you just have to link a route to the FoldController instance that you just created at the App Controller.
